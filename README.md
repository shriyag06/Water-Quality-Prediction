# Water Quality Prediction for Cape Coral, FL
## Goal of the Project
With nearly 50% of US rivers and over one-third of lakes contaminated, leading to unsuitability for activities like swimming and drinking, the project aims to anticipate and assess water quality standards in Cape Town, Florida. Additionally, it seeks to gain deeper insights into the chemical elements influencing water quality levels, in response to pressing global regulations.
## Workflow Summary
The project's execution followed a systematic series of steps. Firstly, the dataset to be utilized was defined. The subsequent step involved working with the dataset, including tasks like selecting important features, imputing missing data, and balancing the water quality categories. At each stage of dataset processing, multiple models were tested, with the best-performing model being chosen. Following that, various training models, such as __Na√Øve Bayes__, __K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)__, __Random Forest__, and __Artificial Neural Network__, were evaluated.
